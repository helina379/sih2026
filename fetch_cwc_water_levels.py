"""
Download real-time/historical water level (WSE) data from CWC's flood
forecasting portal (ffs.india-water.gov.in) for 274 hilly-region stations
identified from the GUARDIAN dataset (Patidar et al. 2024).

Requires: hilly_guardian_stations_final.csv (included alongside this script)
with columns: name, region, code_id, lat, lon.

IMPORTANT -- test this on ONE station first (see main() below, LIMIT=1) to
confirm the endpoint responds correctly on your network before pulling all
274 -- my sandbox couldn't reach ffs.india-water.gov.in to verify end-to-end,
so this needs a real test run before you trust it.

The endpoint/request format is reverse-engineered from GUARDIAN's own public
code (github.com/girishpatidar/discharge_india/codes), not guessed -- but
double-check the response looks sane (see print output) before relying on it.

Run:
    pip install requests pandas --break-system-packages
    python fetch_cwc_water_levels.py
